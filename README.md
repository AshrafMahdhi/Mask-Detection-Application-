# Mask-Detection-Application-
Nateg Enetcom Team 2020 

##Problematic
Lift Lockdown can let countries face new waves of Corona Virus cases so wearing masks will be a necessity for everyone to ensure a level of protection that could help us to continue our normal life as soon as possible, so the government needs to control people after setting rules to wear masks.


##Solution description:
To address this issue we need to identify ppl who don’t wear masks in crowded places malls, markets...To reach this goal we have created a desktop app that could be implemented in different places (hospitals, malls..) in which We have implemented an artificial intelligence model that, given a live camera feed on a target area, detects people without masks and save their pictures.that’s why wearing masks will be …..


##Impact:
The idea of this project is to maintain the protection against Corona Virus and save our country from facing new waves of cases and the spreading again of this disease.


##Technologies used:
Due to the complexity of this project, we decided to work with several technologies and platforms.
So for the detection, we ’ve used a pre-trained model for mask detection which have pretty good accuracy, to exploit it on a reel time streaming application, we ’ve used open cv 2 and Tensorflow libraries.


On the other side, we have used Python : (Pygui, PyQT5)  libraries for designing purposes 
And also to implement all functionalities of this project. 
As backend storage, we ’ve used MySql, to stock credentials and encrypted images.

##Interfaces : 

We have three interfaces , the first for authentification , the second for starting the whole process and crypt and decryp saved 
captures and the las on for visualisation .
